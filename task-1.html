              <h3>Solar System</h3> This is the <b>gravitationally</b> bound system of the <b>sun</b> the objects that <b>orbit</b>
              The largest of such objects are the <b>eight planets</b>,in order from the sun : <b>four terrestrial planets</b>,named <b>Mercury,Venus,
              Earth and Mars</b>;and <b>four gaint planets</b>,including <b>two gas gaints,Jupiter and Satrun,</b> two <b>ice gaints </b>,named <b>Uranus and Neptune.</b>
               The terrestrial planets have a definite surface and are mostly made of <b>rock and metal</b> . The <b>gas gaints</b> are mostly made of <b>hydrogen and helium</b>
               while the ice gaints are mostly made of <b> volatile </b> substance such as <b>water,ammonia,and methane</b>.In some texts,these territial and gaint planets
               are called the <b> Inner Solar System </b>and <b>Outer Solar System</b> planets respectively.

            </p>
            <p>
              The Solar System was <b>formed 4.6 billion years ago</b> from the <b> gravitational collapse</b> of a gaint interstellar
              <b>molecular cloud . </b>Over time,the cloud formed the sun and a <b> protoplanrtary disk</b> that gradually coalesced to
              form planets and other objects . That is the reason why all eight planets have an orbit that lies near the same plane. In the
              present day,99.86% of the solar system's mass is in the sun and most of the <b>remaining mass</b> is contained in the planet
              Jupiter . Six planets,the six largest possible dwarf planets and many other bodies have <b>natural satellites</b> or moons
              orbiting around them . All gaint planets and a few smaller bodies are encircled by <b>planetary rings,</b> composed of ice, dust 
              and sometimes <b>moonlets . </b>
            </p>
            <p>
              The <b>Solar Wind,</b>a stream of <b>charged particles</b> flowing outwards from the sun,creates a bubble-like region
              known as the <b>Heliosphere .</b> thw <b>Heliopause</b> is the point at which pressure from the solar wind is equal to 
              the opposing pressure of the interstellar medium;it extends out to the edge of the scattered disc . The <b>Oort cloud,</b>
              which is tought to be the source for <b> long-period comets,</b>may also exist ata a distance roughly a thousand times further
              than a heliosphere . Beyond these is the end of the Solar System . The Solar Syestem belongs to the <b>Milky Way,</b> and  the 
              cloest star to the solar system(except the sun) is named <b>Proxima Centauri</b> at a distance of 4.2441 <b>light-years</b>
              away.

                <h4>The four terrestrial or inner planets have dense, rocky compositions, few or no moons, and no ring systems. They are composed 
                largely of refractory minerals such as the silicates—which form their crusts and mantles—and metals such as iron and nickel
               which form their cores. Three of the four inner planets (Venus, Earth and Mars) have atmospheres substantial enough to generate
               weather; all have impact craters and tectonic surface features, such as rift valleys and volcanoes. The term inner planet should
               not be confused with inferior planet, which designates those planets that are closer to the Sun than Earth is 
                (i.e. Mercury and Venus).</h4>

                 <h2> MERCURY :</h2>
                 <li> Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System . Not only is Mercury the smallest planet, it is also shrinkling!</li>
                 <li> Mercury is named after the messanger of the Roman gods and Mercury does not have any moons or rings.</li>
                 <li> A day on mercury lasts 59 Earth days and A year on Mercury lasts 88 Earth days.</li>
                 <li> Mercury only has one sunrise every 180 Earth days!</li>
                 <li> The temperature on Mercury during the day is extremely hot.It can reach over 800 degrees F,but at night,
                  temperatures can get extremely cold.It may be-300 F.</li>
                  <li> It orbits the sun in only 88 days. That is faster than any other planet because it is the closest planet to 
                    the sun and it doesn't take very long to go all the way around.</li>
                  <li> Mercury has a thin atmosphere that is made up of oxygen,sodium,hydrogen,helium, and potassium.</li>
                  <li> Only two soacecraft have ever visited Mercury name Mariner 10 and MESSENGER.</li>
                  <li> Only half of Mercury has ever been seen. </li>
                  <li> It's not known who discovered Mercury </li>

                <h2> VENUS: </h2>
                <li> Venus is Earth's closest neighbour in the solar system!she's the second planet from the sun and sometimes
                  called our <b>"sister planet"</b> since its diameter and density are nearly the same as ours.</li>
                <li> After the Sun and Moon,Venus is the brightest object in sky.As the planet look like a bright star in the morning
                    and evening sky,it's often called the <b>"morning star"</b> or <b>"evening star".</b></li>
                <li> Venus day is longer than its year.Venus spin on its axis in 243 Earth-days but orbits the Sun in 224 Earth-days.</li>
               <li> We have learned that Venus's surface is covered with craters,volcanoes,mountains,and big lava plains.</li>
               <li> Venus's surface temperature never budges from about 850 deg F,day and night!Venus manages to have a hotter
                surface than even mercury,which is nearestcplanet to the sun. </li>
                <li> Venus is the only planet in our solar system that rotates clockwise</li>
                <li>Venus was first observed through a telescope in 1610.</li>

                hard,rocky surface you can walk on.</li>
              <li> Mars is called the red planet because of all the iron in the soil.This iron rusts and as a result,makes
                the surface and atmosphere look red.</li>
              <li> Mars may look warm but its very cold.The average temperature is <b>-62 deg celcius.</b></li>
              <li> Mars has two moons,and their name are <b>Phobos and Deimos</b></li>
              <li> Mars can have huge dust stroms which last for months and can over the entier planet.</li>
              <li> A day on Mars is 24.6 hours not much longer than an Earth day,but a year on Mars is 687 Earth days long.That's 
                almost twice as long as on Earth year(imagine only celebrating your birthday every two Earth years!)</li>
              <li> IN 2018,NASA's Curiosity rover found science which scientists think mean there once was life on Mars.</li>

                <h4>The four outer planets, also called giant planets or Jovian planets, collectively make up 99% of the mass known
                 to orbit the Sun.[f] Jupiter and Saturn are together more than 400 times the mass of Earth and consist overwhelmingly
                  of the gases hydrogen and helium, hence their designation as gas giants.[128] Uranus and Neptune are far less massive
                  —less than 20 Earth masses (M🜨) each—and are composed primarily of ices. For these reasons, some astronomers suggest
                   they belong in their own category, ice giants.[129] All four giant planets have rings, although only Saturn's ring 
                   system is easily observed from Earth. The term superior planet designates planets outside Earth's orbit and thus
                    includes both the outer planets and Mars.The ring–moon systems of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus are like miniature 
                    versions of the Solar System; that of Neptune is significantly different, having been disrupted by the capture
                     of its largest moon Triton.</h4>

             <li> Jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun and the biggest planet of our Solar System.Some consider it a failed star since
              it is made out of swirling gases and liquids such as 90% hydrogen, and 10% helium-very similar to sun.</li>
              <li>Jupiter is a gas giant. It is made mostly of hydrogen and helium.
              Jupiter has a very thick atmosphere.
              Jupiter has rings, but they’re very hard to see.</li>
              <li>Jupiter has been known since ancient times because it can be seen without advanced telescopes.</li>
              <li>One day on Jupiter goes by in just 10 hours.
              One year on Jupiter is the same as 11.8 Earth years.</li>
              <li> Jupiter has rings, but they’re very hard to see.</li>
              <li>Jupiter is perpetually covered with clouds of ammonia crystals, which may contain ammonium 
              hydrosulfide as well.[92] The clouds are located in the tropopause layer of the atmosphere, 
              forming bands at different latitudes, known as tropical regions. </li>

             <li> Viewed from Earth, Saturn has an overall hazy yellow-brown appearance.</li>
             <li> Saturn’s atmosphere is composed mostly of molecular hydrogen and helium.</li>
             <li>If hydrogen, helium, and other elements were present in the same proportions as in the Sun’s
              atmosphere, Saturn’s atmosphere would be about 71 percent hydrogen and 28 percent helium by mass.
                According to some theories, helium may have settled out of Saturn’s outer layers. </li>
            <li>It has dozens of moons, including Titan, the second-largest moon in the solar system. </li>
            <li> It is named after the Roman god of agriculture and time, and was known to the Greeks as Cronus.</li>
            <li> It is the flattest planet due to its low density and fast rotation.</li>
            <li>It has a very short day, only 10 hours and 34 minutes long. </li>
            <li> Rings are many and spectacular: Saturn is famous for its rings that are huge but very thin.</li>
            <li> A powerful magnetic: Saturn’s magnetic field is 578 times more powerful than Earth’s magnetic field.</li>

              the moons of the giant planets of the solar system.  </li>
              <li>Uranus takes 84 Earth-years to orbit the Sun once. </li>
              <li> A day in Uranus is shorter than that on Earth and lasts for 17 hrs, 14 min, and 24 sec.</li>
              <li>Uranus has a total volume of 6.833×10^13 cubic km. That means that 63 Earths would fit inside Uranus! </li>
              <li> The diameter of Uranus is 51,118 km and thus is four times bigger than the diameter of our planet Earth.</li>
              <li>Uranus has 13 known rings that range in radii from about 38,000 km to about 98,000 km. The rings are made
